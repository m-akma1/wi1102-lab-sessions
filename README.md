# WI1102 Lab Sessions Archive

This repo is an archive for Lab sessions from Computational Thinking (Semester 1 2024/2025) course. There were 3 labs held overall, each has three problems, sorted by the difficulty. All problems must be solved using Python with restricted operations. This course really just the tip of the iceberg in programming. This course offers the basic of procedural programming: standard input/output, `if else` branching, `for` and `while` loops, arrays and strings, and finally ended with function/procedures. You can see the module [here](modul.pdf).

This course is designed for general student with no programming background, hence the name WI (stands for _Wajib ITB_). But somehow, a lot of students struggle with the lab sessions, even some from STEI faculty. I recommend to try thinking "computationally" more, learn the Python documentations, and practice beginner competitive programming problem if you're unfamiliar with this topic. For more experienced student, use the project assignment to explore more about Python's libraries and other tools. You can see my project [here](https://github.com/m-akma1/wi1102-project).


Back to the labs, the material for each lab is as follows:
- [Lab 1](/praktikum-1/): basic input, output, and branching (`if else`).
- [Lab 2](/praktikum-2/): arrays with `for` and `while` loops.
- [Lab 3](/praktikum-3/): functions and procedures using `def`.

Out of the three problems, problem 1 and 2 usually in the easy area, while problem 3 can be hard or really hard relative from the first two. To get a full score, your solution must output the correct solution to all test case whilst also **only using the allowed operations**. Don't forget to also make your code as readable as possible. You can get points deducted if you forget to put specifications, variable dictionaries, or name variables "unconventionally" since the code is **graded manually**. Once you get a grasp, these labs are trivial. Goodluck! :)
